Evaluate the background cleanliness and distraction level in a cat photograph. Score how well the visual territory behind and around the cat supports the subject by staying calm and non-competitive, allowing the viewer's eye to land on the cat and remain there.

A clean background does not need to be empty, white, or blurred into bokeh. It simply needs to be calm enough that it does not compete with the cat for the viewer's attention. A plain wall, a simple bedspread, or a muted desk where objects recede naturally can all score well. What matters is that the cat stands out as the clear subject of the photograph.

Score poorly when the background distracts:
- Visually noisy backgrounds packed with bright objects, busy patterns, competing colors, or crowds of shapes that fracture the viewer's attention
- Backgrounds where the cat becomes just one more element in a chaotic visual field rather than the obvious subject
- Cluttered scenes with tangles of wires, piles of bright toys, bold wallpaper patterns, or other high-contrast elements that pull the eye away from the cat
- Backgrounds where strong colors, shapes, or lighting compete directly with the cat for visual dominance

Score highly when the background supports:
- The viewer's eye naturally goes to the cat and stays there without wandering
- Background elements are muted, receded, or visually subordinate to the cat
- The surrounding space feels calm and allows the cat to be the focal point
- Even in imperfect real-world settings, the background does not actively fight the subject for attention

This evaluation is relative to each photograph's own setting. A garden, kitchen, or living room can each be either calm or cluttered depending on how the specific scene presents itself. The question is never whether the location is prestigious or professionally arranged, but whether the background lets the cat stand out. A messy room where the cat happens to be positioned against a clear section of wall can score well; a beautiful outdoor scene where dappled light and overlapping foliage create visual chaos behind the cat can score poorly.
