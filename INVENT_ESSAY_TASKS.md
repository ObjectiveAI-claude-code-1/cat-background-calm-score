1. Assess the visual quietness of the background by examining the space surrounding the cat as if the cat were not there. Determine whether the background feels restful and settled or loud and chaotic. Look at the tones, patterns, shapes, and colors present in the background and judge whether they sit calmly together in harmony or jostle against each other with competing energy. A plain wall, a soft blanket, or a muted desk with objects that recede naturally should be recognized as quiet. Backgrounds packed with bright objects, bold patterns, tangled clutter, sharp contrasts, or dense visual information should be recognized as loud. The key question is whether the background, on its own terms, carries a sense of stillness or vibrates with unresolved visual noise.

2. Evaluate the subject separation between the cat and its background by examining whether the cat emerges as a distinct, primary visual element or blends into its surroundings. Look for contrast between the cat and the space behind it — contrast in tone, texture, color, or spatial depth — that creates a clear visual boundary and makes the cat the obvious focal point of the image. A dark cat against a light surface, a bright tabby against a muted room, or a soft furred animal against a flat geometric backdrop all demonstrate strong separation. A cat that matches its background in color, tone, and visual weight, or that sits among objects of similar size and prominence, demonstrates poor separation. The question is whether the photograph makes the cat unmistakably the subject or allows it to become just one more element in the scene.

3. Evaluate the distraction resistance of the background by identifying whether any specific elements actively compete with the cat for the viewer's attention. Scan the background for individual objects, colors, light sources, or visual features that pull the eye away from the cat — a bright screen glowing behind the subject, a bold piece of art on the wall, a vivid colored object in an otherwise calm scene, harsh backlighting from a window, or another animal partially visible at the edge of the frame. Even a single strong distractor in an otherwise quiet background can fracture the viewing experience and pull the gaze away from the cat. The question is whether the viewer's eye can land on the cat and remain there without being tugged away by competing elements, or whether specific attractors in the background break ranks and demand attention that belongs to the subject.
